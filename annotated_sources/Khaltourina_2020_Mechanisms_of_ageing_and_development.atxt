The disease criteria used by the World Health Organization (WHO) were applied to human biological aging in order to assess whether aging can be classiﬁed as a
disease. These criteria were developed for the 11th revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD) and included disease diagnostics, mechanisms, course
and outcomes, known interventions, and linkage to genetic and environmental factors.

Results: Biological aging can be diagnosed with frailty indices, functional, blood-based biomarkers. A number of major causal mechanisms of human aging involved
in various organs have been described, such as inﬂammation, replicative cellular senescence, immune senescence, proteostasis failures, mitochondrial dysfunctions,
ﬁbrotic propensity, hormonal aging, body composition changes, etc. We identiﬁed a number of clinically proven interventions, as well as genetic and environmental
factors of aging. Therefore, aging ﬁts the ICD-11 criteria and can be considered a disease. Our proposal was submitted to the ICD-11 Joint Task force, and this led to
the inclusion of the extension code for “Ageing-related” (XT9T) into the “Causality” section of the ICD-11. This might lead to greater focus on biological aging in
global health policy and might provide for more opportunities for the new therapy developers.

{Introduction}
1. Introduction 

Aging (hereafter biological aging) can be deﬁned as a complex interrelated network of progressive functionally-deleterious phenotypic deviations (with respect to the young adult phenotype) underlying biological aging, leading to a decline in individuals’ adaptability, physiological and mental function, as well as resilience.

There are discussions of whether aging should be classiﬁed as a disease or not. A number researchers argued that aging should be considered and treated as a disease (Bulterijs et al., 2015; de Grey and Rae, 2007; Lakatta, 2015; Stambler, 2017; Zhavoronkov and Bhullar, 2015). 

[Human_biological_aging a:do/Disease]

The WHO developed a deﬁnition of disease for the purposes of 11th ICD revision: “A disease is a set of dysfunction(s) in any of the body systems deﬁned by: 1. Symptomatology: manifestations: known pattern of signs, symptoms and related ﬁndings 2. Aetiology: an underlying explanatory mechanism 3. Course and outcome: a distinct pattern of development over time 4. Treatment response: a known pattern of response to interventions 5. Linkage to genetic factors: e.g., genotypes, patterns of gene expression 6. Linkage to interacting environmental factors” (World Health Organization, 2011). We undertook an eﬀort to determine whether aging ﬁts the ICD deﬁnition of disease as per the current state of medical research. An earlier version of this review was submitted to the WHO, which resulted in the addition of the WHO ICD extension code "Ageing-Related" (XT9T) for aging-related diseases in the “Causality” section of the ICD-11 (Calimport and Bentley, 2019).

2. Materials and methods 

To obtain information on signs and symptoms of aging we screened the most clinically relevant studies of aging biomarkers, including vast amounts of research literature on frailty indices. The analysis of the aetiology and underlying explanatory mechanisms of aging were performed in several stages. We initially produced a comprehensive list of aging-related pathological processes, with some but not all of them being listed in ICD-10 as separate diseases, and others added from research literature (Supplementary Table S1). We then screened medical research literature for reviews of the mechanisms of these aging-related pathological processes and diseases in humans at the level of organs, tissues, cells, signaling molecules, pathways, gene expression and interventions. Animal research was reviewed as subsidiary when it covered important knowledge gaps about certain aging-related cellular processes, molecular pathways or epigenetic changes associated with aging and diseases. We also reviewed pathogenetic processes of aging identiﬁed in biogerontological research literature (de Grey and Rae, 2007; LópezOtín et al., 2013). Additionally, we documented clinical studies and animal research on the eﬀects of potential geroprotective interventions on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and other relevant clinical endpoints in humans, as well as on lifespan of model organisms. We documented the ﬁndings on cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging-related pathological processes and the beneﬁcial eﬀects of geroprotective interventions.

{Results}
3. Results 

3.1. Symptomatology and the course of disease 

Large-scale cohort studies in humans and detailed investigations into the biology of human aging provide individually validated biomarkers and mechanisms, potentially leading to recommendations for targeted interventions (Jia et al., 2017; Moeller et al., 2017). 

3.1.1. Blood-based biomarkers of aging 

A number of large studies identiﬁed sets of blood-based biomarkers of aging which retrospectively predict morbidity and mortality in large cohort studies and clinical trials (Bürkle et al., 2015; Horvath, 2013; Moeller et al., 2017; Putin et al., 2016). These kinds of studies provide tools for predicting clinically signiﬁcant aging-related outcomes, like risks of morbidity, mortality, aging related diseases (Sebastiani et al., 2017), cognitive or physical function decline or frailty. Some proposed (Wagner et al., 2016) clinically signiﬁcant bloodbased biomarkers of aging include inﬂammation agents, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Holly et al., 2013; Mitnitski et al., 2015; Sebastiani et al., 2017; Soysal et al., 2016), TNF-a (Langmann et al., 2017; Nascimento et al., 2018), C-reactive protein (CRP) (Sebastiani et al., 2017; Soysal et al., 2016; Velissaris et al., 2017), and other inﬂammatory markers, glucose metabolism biomarkers such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Belsky et al., 2015) and plasma glucose (Mamoshina et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2019; Zaslavsky et al., 2016), adipokines (Mitnitski et al., 2015), homocysteine (Crimmins et al., 2008; Mitnitski et al., 2015), thyroid hormones (Suzuki et al., 2012), Nterminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (Draper et al., 2018; Raymond, 2003), as well as troponin, albumin (Bouajila et al., 2018) or albumin/creatinine ratio (Mitnitski et al., 2015; Putin et al., 2016), lipid biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Carreira et al., 2012; Sebastiani et al., 2016), and triglycerides (TGs) (Irvin et al., 2018; Rhee et al., 2019).

3.1.2. Function-based and anthropometric biomarkers 

Clinically signiﬁcant physical function and anthropometric biomarkers of aging include walking speed, standing from a chair, walking balance, grip strength (Kim et al., 2018a), body mass index (BMI) (Ismail et al., 2002; Muñoz et al., 2010), waist circumference, muscle mass (Kim et al., 2016c) and others (Wagner et al., 2016).

3.1.3. Aging-related frailty and Frailty Indices 

Fried et al. described frailty phenotype criteria including unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity (Fried et al., 2001). Frailty Index was suggested (Mitnitski et al., 2001) as a proxy measure of aging, and thus can be used (although crudely) as a metric that allows researchers and clinicians to compare the rates of aging between individuals and populations (Rockwood et al., 2005; Rockwood and Mitnitski, 2007). Prevalence of pre-frailty and frailty signiﬁcantly increases with age, with pre-frailty prevalence reaching as high as 47% in old age, according to some studies (Buckinx et al., 2015). Yet, frailty is related to biological age stronger than to chronological age (Romero-Ortuno and Kenny, 2012). ICD-10 includes the R54 code for “Senility”, while ICD-10-CM codes this condition as "Age-related physical debility". However, frailty has become an established term after the introduction of the Rockwood Frailty Scale in 2005 (Rockwood et al., 2005). Frailty indices (FIs) are often used in epidemiological and clinical studies to monitor health and to predict mortality and morbidity risks. A number of similar FIs which are currently used (Jeong et al., 2013; Rockwood et al., 2005) correlate better than calendar age with many clinically signiﬁcant endpoints, including mortality (Ravindrarajah et al., 2013), postoperative outcomes (Lin et al., 2016), sexual health (Lee et al., 2012), cancer survival (Ommundsen et al., 2014), etc. Frailty can be currently measured starting from the age as young as 15 (Rockwood et al., 2011). A number of lifestyle, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical interventions have been proposed, developed and used to prevent or reduce frailty levels (Cesari et al., 2015).

3.1.4. Combination of blood-based biomarkers with Frailty indices 

Mitnitski et al. (Mitnitski et al., 2015) analyzed 40 biomarkers of cellular aging, inﬂammation, hematology and immunosenescence using baseline data and 7-year mortality data from the Newcastle 85+ Study, characterized the discriminatory ability of this biomarker-based frailty index (FI-B) to predict mortality compared to individual biomarkers, and then combined this FI-B with a clinical deﬁcits frailty index (FI-C) to see whether the combined FI-B and FI-C index possessed greater ability to predict mortality than the FI-B alone. The biomarkers which were signiﬁcant predictors of mortality included blood-based inﬂammation biomarkers such as high sensitivity CRP, leptin, adiponectin, homocysteine, albumin, hematological biomarkers (hemoglobin, platelets, white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes), biomarkers of immunosenescence, as well as transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1). The researchers found that the FI-B has signiﬁcantly greater discriminatory accuracy to predict mortality than any one biomarker or biomarker subgroup alone, and that the combined FI-B and FI-C index possessed the greatest overall ability to predict mortality.

3.1.5. Genetic biomarkers of aging 

A number of genetic biomarkers of aging have been proposed, including telomere length (Zhang et al., 2014b), T-cell DNA rearrangement (Zubakov et al., 2010) and DNA methylation, as well as some other epigenetic modiﬁcations (Pal and Tyler, 2016). Methylation patterns of certain CpG sites in DNA are highly correlated with age. A number of epigenetic aging scores have been developed with high ability to predict mortality (Fransquet et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019) and calendar age including Horvath’s epigenetic clock (Horvath, 2013), epigenetic clock by Hannum et al. (Hannum et al., 2013), GrimAge (Lu et al., 2019), and others (Horvath et al., 2018; Weidner et al., 2014). Some epigenetic clocks measure accelerated aging including DNAmPhenoAge acceleration (Levine et al., 2018) and AgeAccelGrim (Lu et al., 2019). Data suggest that these epigenetic aging clocks may be altered by lifestyle (Quach et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019b) or, possibly, by some therapeutic interventions (Fahy et al., 2019; Sae-Lee et al., 2018). Future clinical research will reveal how relevant these indicators are in practice.

3.1.6. Indices of biological age 

A large number of indices of biological age have been proposed. Some biological age formulas measure biological aging per se with a number of biomarkers (Jia et al., 2017), while a number of research groups use Klemera and Doubal’s method in such indices, which adds age acceleration (deceleration) to calendar age (Klemera and Doubal, 2006). Other groups used indicators of pathologies (Hochschild, 1989) or artiﬁcial intelligence methods to create indices of biological aging (Putin et al., 2016; Pyrkov et al., 2018; Rahman and Adjeroh, 2019). In sum, there is a growing number of diagnostic tools which can be used to assess the rate of biological aging, to develop new medicines and to monitor eﬀectiveness of interventions. Research on FIs reached considerable degree of consensus, while the research on blood-born, epigenetic and other biomarkers is gaining momentum. Therefore, aging diagnostics is already available and is developing further.

3.2. Aetiology: an underlying explanatory mechanism 

We performed a search in the medical research literature and identiﬁed a number of interrelated pathological processes which are known to take part in the pathological aging-related processes and changes of various systems and structures of the human body listed in Table S1. 

[do/PathologicalProcess subclass-of:BiologicalProcess]

3.2.1. Chronic low-grade inﬂammation 

[Chronic_low-grade_inflammation a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Aging-related chronic low-grade inﬂammation ("inﬂamm-aging") is described by the increase in inﬂammatory markers and agents in aging, in the absence of overt infection (“aseptic” inﬂammation). There is overwhelming epidemiological evidence that the state of mild inﬂammation, revealed via elevated levels of inﬂammatory biomarkers such as CRP, IL-6 (Mitnitski et al., 2015; Soysal et al., 2016), and potentially a few other inﬂammation biomarkers, is predictive of many aging phenotypes, such as changes in body composition, energy production and utilization, metabolic homeostasis, immune senescence, neuronal health and frailty (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014). Circulating proinﬂammatory molecules are strong predictors of age-related morbidity and mortality (Barron et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017b). There is mounting clinical evidence that local production of inﬂammatory cytokines can drive phenotypes and pathologies associated with aging, including atherosclerosis (Lorenzatti and Retzlaﬀ, 2016), diabetes (Park et al., 2014), pulmonary diseases (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014; Murray and Chotirmall, 2015), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014). Neuroinﬂammation is the major route of nervous system aging and degenerative disease development (Yin et al., 2016).

[Atherosclerosis a:AgingAssociatedDisease]
[Diabetes a:AgingAssociatedDisease]
[Alzheimers_disease a:AgingAssociatedDisease]

Aging-related increase in the levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines is caused by replicative cellular senescence (Coppé et al., 2010), increased body fat share, mitochondrial damage, damaged macromolecules (Shi et al., 2015) and cells (self-debris) that accumulate with age due to increased production and/or inadequate elimination (Franceschi and Campisi, 2014) and microbiota changes (Nagpal et al., 2018). Exercise (Monteiro-Junior et al., 2018) and the decreased BMI leads to decrease in serum inﬂammatory markers (Fedewa et al., 2017). Both physical exercise (Naci and Ioannidis, 2013) and intentional weight loss in people with preexisting obesity (Kritchevsky et al., 2015) are associated with reduced all-cause mortality. Healthy dietary patterns are also associated with lower inﬂammatory markers (Soltani et al., 2017). The consumption of olive oil (Schwingshackl et al., 2015) as well as nuts (Neale et al., 2017) decreases inﬂammation markers and reduces the risks of cancer incidence (Pelucchi et al., 2011), cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Chen et al., 2017b; Schwingshackl and Hoﬀmann, 2014). Coﬀee consumption also reduces serum concentration of CRP (Zhang and Zhang, 2018), and may reduce cancer incidence (Poole et al., 2017). Vitamin D supplementation decreases CRP level (Mirhosseini et al., 2018), and it may also reduce all-cause mortality in adults (Chowdhury et al., 2014) and cancer risks (Grant, 2018), perhaps due to high rates of vitamin D deﬁciency in the modern societies. There is evidence that the use of aspirin, an anti-inﬂammatory drug, is associated with modestly reduced all-cause, cardiovascular mortality (in non-hypertensive subjects) and cancer prevalence, as well as mortality in older adults (Sutcliﬀe et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2015). Therefore, all the above-mentioned interventions can be viewed as both anti-inﬂammatory and geroprotective (capable of addressing pathological aging processes and extending lifespan in humans). Glucosamine and chondroitin use reduces CRP in healthy subjects (Navarro et al., 2015), and may be associated with reduction in allcause mortality, mortality from cancer and respiratory diseases, according to the observational studies (Bell et al., 2012).

3.2.2. Replicative cellular senescence 

[Replicative_cellular_senescence a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Cellular senescence refers to the durable arrest of cell proliferation that occurs when cells experience certain types of alterations, including telomere shortening and activation of damage sensing pathways, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) (Campisi, 2013; He and Sharpless, 2017). The majority of senescent cells can be detected via beta-galactosidase assay, estimation of Lamin B1 loss and markers of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Both telomere shortening in various tissues (Ishikawa et al., 2016) and the accumulation of post-mitotic senescent cells increase with age (Belsky et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2009; Sørensen et al., 2016). Telomere length (TL) correlates negatively with the risks of cardiovascular (Akasheva et al., 2015; Dudinskaya et al., 2015; Haycock et al., 2014; Strazhesko et al., 2015), neurodegenerative (Forero et al., 2016), lung (Calhoun et al., 2016) diseases, and mortality in people aged 60 and over (Cawthon et al., 2003; Sørensen et al., 2016), as well as in cancer survivors (Xu et al., 2016). Telomere shortening is a major pathway of cellular senescence. When telomeres reach critical shortness, the cell enters either senescence, normally through the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (p16INK4a), or apoptosis. The intracellular enzyme telomerase can promote telomere lengthening, preventing the age-related shortening that comes with cell division. Additionally, cellular senescence can be induced by stressors like mitochondrial or DNA damage, oxidative stress (Reichert and Stier, 2017), as well as the use of cytotoxic/genotoxic therapies. The causal mechanisms for the associations between age-related increase in cellular senescence and the disease pathogenesis include pro-inﬂammatory and pro-ﬁbrotic SASP of senescent cells, the loss of proliferation-competent cells, and the reduction of the total number of functional tissue cells. SASP has been shown to drive local and systemic inﬂammation accompanied by macrophage and lymphocyte inﬁltration, apoptosis and ﬁbrosis. Recent evidence in ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells has shown that cellular senescence is accompanied by a striking increase in the secretion of 40–80 factors that participate in intracellular signaling. SASP proteins are generally induced at the level of mRNA and include a wide range of growth factors, proteases, chemokines and cytokines. Proteins that are known to stimulate inﬂammation, including IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth regulated oncogene (GRO)-α, monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCPs) MCP-2, MCP-3, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-1, MMP-3, and many of the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs), are among the most robustly induced and secreted of these factors (Freund et al., 2010). While cellular senescence may play a protective role in some conditions like wound healing, cancer or ﬁbrosis, the burden of senescent cells seems to be net-detrimental for aging organisms. Replicative arrest is oncoprotective, however, on the other side, SASP induction by the senescent cells might promote cancer. Also, senescent cells can compromise tissue cancer resistance capacity. These ﬁndings open opportunities for new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of age-related diseases (Hodes et al., 2016).

There are numerous examples of involvement of senescent cells in the pathogenesis of the diseases of aging, including CVDs (Alique et al., 2018; Krouwer et al., 2012; Wang and Bennett, 2012), AD (Bhat et al., 2012; Ojo et al., 2015), glaucoma (Liton et al., 2005), cataract (Zhou et al., 2015), and osteoarthritis (McCulloch et al., 2017). The interventions which prevent or reduce the harmful eﬀects of cellular senescence are still being explored. Physical activity (Mundstock et al., 2015) and healthy dietary patterns, such as Mediterranean diet, as well as fruit and vegetable consumption might be related to longer telomere length (TL), while consumption of certain food categories including processed meat, cereals and sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as excessive red meat consumption may be associated with shorter TL (Raﬁe et al., 2017). Also, metformin use might be associated with larger telomere length in prediabetic subjects (de Kreutzenberg et al., 2015). Statins modulate telomerase activity and reduce telomere erosion (Boccardi et al., 2013; Paradisi et al., 2012), while atorvastatin activates telomerase in patients free of atherosclerosis (Strazhesko et al., 2016). Some other potential pharmacological interventions against cellular senescence have been identiﬁed, but their eﬀects and toxicity still need to be studied. For example, quercetin is known to promote apoptosis in senescent cells (Khan et al., 2016). Cycloastragenol (TA-65, Astragalus propinquus extract) is purported to have telomerase activation activity. Astragalus may be beneﬁcial for patients with non-small-cell lung (He et al., 2013) and hepatocellular cancers (Tian et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2009), and early macular degeneration (Dow and Harley, 2016). Lubricant eye drops with N-acetylcarnosine, a carnosine prodrug, at physiological concentration might remarkably reduce the rate of telomere shortening in the lens and improve visual functions in older people (Babizhayev and Yegorov, 2016). At the same time, carnosine supplementation may reduce oxidative stress (Regazzoni et al., 2016), while anserin and carnosine supplements might improve cognitive abilities and physical functioning in this group (Hisatsune et al., 2016; Szcześniak et al., 2014). Olive phenols might prevent cellular senescence (Menicacci et al., 2017), but further research is needed.

3.2.3. Proteostasis failures 

[Proteostasis_failure a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is a network of biological pathways responsible for protein folding, traﬃcking, metabolism and degradation within and outside cells, which is essential for health maintenance. Pathological processes of aging impose signiﬁcant chronic stress on proteostatic systems, which induces various subsequent cascades of pathogenesis. Aggregations of misfolded proteins in proteinaceous inclusions are common to many age-related diseases, including cardiovascular, kidney, liver, eye diseases, osteoporosis (Yamagishi et al., 2015), diabetes (Nenna et al., 2015), as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and Parkinson's disease (PD) (Chiti and Dobson, 2017; Iannuzzi et al., 2014). 

[Aggregation_of_misfolded_proteins a:do/Symptom do/symptomFor:do/Cardiovascular_system_disease,do/Kidney_disease,do/Liver_disease,do/Eye_disease,do/Osteoporosis,do/Diabetes,do/Neurodegenerative_disease]

Misfolded protein aggregation is found not only in patients with certain diseases, for example, signiﬁcant amyloid deposits are found in 20 to 30% of the brains of healthy older adults (Rodrigue et al., 2009). Damaged macromolecules accumulate with age due to increased production and/or inadequate elimination of certain proteins which promotes pathological processes, both speciﬁc, including cognitive decline and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and non-speciﬁc such as inﬂammation. 

[Amyloid_deposite a:do/Symptom]

There are diﬀerent mechanisms of misfolded protein toxicity. Smaller oligomers are the major pathogenic source of the neuropathic diseases of the central nervous system, as they interact with various cellular structures including phospholipid bilayers of the cell membrane and a number of cell receptors. At the same time, pathogenic species in non-neuropathic systemic or localized amyloidoses include both (Duca et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2012). Elastolysis is mainly triggered by elastases from inﬂammatory cells that secrete neutrophil elastase, MMPs (especially MMP-2), and cathepsins. 

[Neutrophile_elastase a:do/PathologyProduct]
[MMP-2 a:do/PathologyProduct,MMP]

Higher serum levels of MMP-2, cathepsins and EDPs were independently associated with baseline aortic pulse wave velocity, and MMP-2 and EDP levels independently predicted all-cause mortality in a cohort study of people with predialysis CKD (Smith et al., 2012). The downstream signaling of EDPs involves spliced-galactosidase (s-Gal), NF-κB, Sialidase 1 (Neu-1), ERC, M3 ganglioside, lactosylceramide, etc. (Duca et al., 2016). 

Inadequate protein clearance is a mechanism implicated in many pathological processes of aging. For example, decreased or inadequate clearance of Aβ leads to the accumulation of Aβ oligomers and larger aggregate formation (Kundra et al., 2017). Aging-related increase in oxidative stress and decrease in mitochondrial function reduce the effectiveness of the proteostasis networks (Chiti and Dobson, 2017). Many proteostatic processes and systems are impaired or overloaded during aging. Thus, the function of the chaperome, the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular folding machines to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Brehme et al., 2014). Autophagy and proteasome activities have both been found to decrease with aging (Chiti and Dobson, 2017; Morimoto and Cuervo, 2014), but to a lesser extent in healthy centenarians (Emanuele et al., 2014). Defective autophagy is assumed to play a role in some agingrelated conditions, like osteoarthritis (Li et al., 2016; Nakamura et al., 2010), AD, PD (Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015), and cancer (Xie and Zhou, 2018).

Interventions to reduce the burden of misfolded proteins vary depending on the protein species. Some of them are being explored yet (Bartolome et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2016). Proper dietary (Hanson et al., 2013) and sleep regimes (Ooms et al., 2014) might be helpful to reduce Aβ levels in the nervous system in at least some demographic groups. There is some evidence that 17β-estradiol administration reduces plasma Aβ40 in HRT-naïve postmenopausal women (Baker et al., 2003), although safety and eﬀectiveness of various regimes of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) against dementias for women is being questioned (Marjoribanks et al., 2017). Some innovative therapies like plasma exchange with 5% albumin are promising against accumulation of Aβ peptides (Boada et al., 2017; Cuberas-Borrós et al., 2018). A natural product dihydroergocristine can reduce the burden of Aβ (Lei et al., 2015). Dihydroergocristine use may have been associated with better survival in dementia patients in one cohort study (Wu et al., 2015a). Simvastatin use leads to decreased levels of misfolded p-tau181 protein in cerebrospinal ﬂuids (Li et al., 2017a; Riekse et al., 2006). Statin use may be associated with lower risks of cognitive decline (Smith et al., 2017) and dementia (Chou et al., 2014; Geifman et al., 2017). Many interventions which reduce the burden of AGEs are known to have beneﬁcial health eﬀects in older adults, including dietary modiﬁcations (Uribarri et al., 2003), anti-diabetic drugs (sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (Bekki et al., 2018)), some of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (Honda et al., 2012; Rabbani et al., 2012), some statins (Cuccurullo et al., 2006; Fukushima et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2010), or anti-oxidants such as carnosine (Babizhayev et al., 2012), quercetin (Byun et al., 2017; Nenna et al., 2015), and curcumin with Boswellia serrata (Chilelli et al., 2016).

3.2.4. Immune senescence 
[Immune_senescence a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Aging is a risk factor for the immune system’s dysfunction (immune senescence), which leads to signiﬁcantly increased vulnerability to infections, and poorer response to newly encountered antigens, as well as weaker responses to vaccines and immunotherapies for cancer and other diseases common in the older demographics (Pera et al., 2015). A major causal mechanism of immune senescence is the decline in the number of naïve T-cells (Vescovini et al., 2014) due to thymic involution, T-cell cellular senescence and impaired homeostatic proliferation (Bellon and Nicot, 2017). The loss of naïve T-cell population correlates with frailty (Johnstone et al., 2017), mortality (Mitnitski et al., 2015) and well as with the risks of certain non-communicable diseases (Moro-García et al., 2015). Aging-related metabolic changes, including hormonal changes (Pera et al., 2015), low-grade inﬂammation, increased exposure of T-cells to pro-inﬂammatory molecules, DNA damage and expansion of dysfunctional T-cells clones are primary causal factors implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of immune senescence. At the same time, persistent viral load through lifespan and that of cytomegalovirus (CMV), in particular is the major promoter of immune senescence (Bellon and Nicot, 2017). CMV is highly prevalent worldwide and persists in its host for life. In synergy with aging, it promotes diﬀerentiation of CD8+ T-cells, and the acquisition of a low CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio, which is a marker of aging-related or a virus-mediated depletion of CD8+ naïve T-cell pools, and which correlates independently with frailty, morbidity and mortality in older people (Johnstone et al., 2017; Mitnitski et al., 2015; Weltevrede et al., 2016; Wikby et al., 1998). This suggests that the loss of immune-competent Tcells in combination with CMV persistence are among causal mechanisms of aging and age-related morbidity and mortality. Some potential geroprotective interventions are known to improve T-cell immunity. Regular exercise increases naïve T-cell count (Duggal et al., 2018), improves immune function and results in lower incidence of disease (Arem et al., 2015; World Health Organization, 2010). Frequent acute (but not extreme) physical exercise may increase relative CD8+ T-cell telomere length, and allow naïve T-cells to occupy "vacant" immune space and increase the naïve T-cell repertoire (Simpson et al., 2010). Vaccine response in adults can be improved with probiotics (Lei et al., 2017) or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (Mannick et al., 2014). Antiviral therapies which are eﬀective against CMV and some other viruses and can reverse the development of immune senescence in mice (Beswick et al., 2013), and their prophylactic use might reduce mortality among renal transplant (Reddy et al., 2003) and allogeneic stem cell transplant (Marty et al., 2017) patients. Long-term safety and eﬀectiveness of these interventions in terms of preventing immunosenescence needs to be explored.

3.2.5. Increased ﬁbrotic propensity 
[Fibrosis a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Aging is associated with signiﬁcantly increased risks of chronic ﬁbroproliferative conditions, including hepatic, renal, heart, vascular, and pancreatic ﬁbrosis (Rosenbloom et al., 2017), idiopathic lung ﬁbrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), infertility (Briley et al., 2016), erectile dysfunction (El-Sakka, 2011), (Karsdal et al., 2014), as well as eye diseases with ﬁbrotic components (glaucoma, secondary cataract (Rosenbloom et al., 2017), retinopathies (Roy et al., 2016), and dry eye disease). Fibrosis develops as a reaction to damage, such as mechanical damage, toxins, inﬂammation, oxidative stress, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) overactivation, hypoxia, which all may lead to pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein. Formation of excess ﬁbrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue occurs as part of a reparative or reactive process (e.g. wound healing). When a critical organ such as the heart, liver, kidney or pancreas is aﬀected by ﬁbrosis it can lead to the loss of its integrity and function, which can result in further cascades of systemic damage. Also, reduced blue light transmission due to aging-related ﬁbrotic eye diseases may impair the photoentrainment of circadian rhythm leading to sleep disorders (Ayaki et al., 2016), and, possibly, higher levels of systemic inﬂammation (Kessel et al., 2011). The TGF-β superfamily is the most important ECM regulator, which plays important roles in embryogenesis and development, with TGF-β1 being the major pro-ﬁbrotic protein (Hu et al., 2018). TGF-β1 signaling increases with age (Parker et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2006), and it can be exacerbated by diabetes (Meng et al., 2016; Mou et al., 2016; Qiao et al., 2017). Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity-derived inﬂammation may also lead to “meta-ﬁbrosis” (excessive ECM formation) (Lark and Wasserman, 2017).

Dysregulated signaling between certain molecules and pathways, including TGF-β, in particular TGF-β1, SMAD, SNAI1, CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) (Lipson et al., 2012), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Chaudhary et al., 2007), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), galectin-3 and lysyl oxidase homolog 2 (LOXL2) as well as MTORC1 and MTORC2 via PI3K/AKT and Wnt pathways (Meng et al., 2016), which can be stimulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (especially Nox4), inﬂammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1a, IL-13, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) (Lark and Wasserman, 2017), hypoxia (hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α, HIF-1-α) and leading ultimately to endothelial-mesenchymal transition and ﬁbrosis formation (Li et al., 2017c). Activated ﬁbroblasts, pericytes and other cells increase production of collagen, ﬁbronectin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and other ECM proteins. This leads to the production and accumulation of sub-pools of cross-linked proteins that can be termed the ‘end products’ of ﬁbrosis. Hypoxia, one of the systemic factors of aging, also acts to increase SNAI1 level mediated by HIF-1-α. Mechanisms of tissue remodeling and inﬂammation resolution leading to clearance of ﬁbrotic matrix by extracellular proteolysis and/or endocytosis are inadequate in ﬁbrosis (Piera-Velazquez et al., 2016). Within the course of ﬁbrosis formation, proteases (such as MMP-9, MMP-12, MMP-13), secreted as a part of the damage response, degrade the existing ECM components and release various protein fragments (neo-epitopes) into circulation (Giannandrea and Parks, 2014). Fibrosis research is still in development. A number of interventions with known anti-aging eﬀects in certain groups of patients are shown to inhibit liver ﬁbrosis progression in humans, including healthy diet (Perumpail et al., 2017), coﬀee consumption (Liu et al., 2015), statins (Kim et al., 2017), aspirin (Poujol-Robert et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014), RAAS inhibitors (Kim et al., 2016b), and, possibly, liraglutide (Kahal et al., 2014). In fact, RAAS targeting drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs prevent and sometimes even regress myocardial, renal, hepatic, and muscle ﬁbrosis and alleviate COPD symptoms (Garg et al., 2015; Shrikrishna et al., 2012). N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant drug, improves symptoms of COPD (Firuzi et al., 2011), and it could be eﬀective in other ﬁbrotic conditions, including renal diseases (Ahmadi et al., 2017), liver failure (Chughlay et al., 2016), myocardial infarctions (Talasaz et al., 2014). Dasatinib plus quercetin combination may alleviate idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (Justice et al., 2019). CoQ10 and selenium supplementation may lead to less ﬁbrosis in the older people, which may explain lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in one study (Alehagen et al., 2018; Lehagen et al., 2018). Additionally, cGMP-speciﬁc phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, the NO-inducing drugs that address erectile dysfunction, seem not only to prevent and reverse penile ﬁbrosis (El-Sakka, 2011), but also to reduce mortality in men with CVDs including myocardial infarctions (Andersson et al., 2017) and diabetes (Hackett et al., 2017). Pentoxifylline, a non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors may be eﬀective against miscellaneous ﬁbrotic conditions (Wen et al., 2017) and preserve kidney function in CKD (Chen et al., 2017c). A number of interventions reduce arterial stiﬀness, including physical exercise (Zhang et al., 2018b) and RAAS blockers and metformin (Wu et al., 2015a).

3.2.6. Aging-related mitochondrial dysfunctions 
[Aging-related_mitochondrial_dysfunction a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Mitochondria are organelles in charge of energy (adenosine triphosphate, ATP) production, cellular respiration, storage of calcium ions (Ca2+), regulation of cellular apoptositis, etc.
Mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction is a hallmark of aging and manifests in decreased ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide + (NAD+) production, as well as excessive oxidative stress. It is involved in major pathogenetic processes of aging, including inﬂammation (Picca et al., 2018), cellular senescence (Reichert and Stier, 2017; Schuliga et al., 2018), IR (Jin and Diano, 2018; Tardito, 1990), impaired proteostasis (Chiti and Dobson, 2017; Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015), decreased stem cell functionality (Zhang et al., 2018a), muscle loss (Coen et al., 2013; Doria et al., 2012), and neurodegeneration (Brooks et al., 2007; Mosconi et al., 2006). Aging-related mitochondrial dysfunctions aﬀect multiple body systems, while energy-intensive organs like muscles (Coen et al., 2013; Doria et al., 2012) or the nervous system are particularly vulnerable. For example, AD is also accompanied by decreased mitochondrial bioenergetics (Brooks et al., 2007), which can occur as early as a decade before the diagnosis (Mosconi et al., 2006). The hallmarks of aging-related mitochondrial dysfunctions include mitochondria loss in aging, decreased ATP and NAD+ production, impaired mitochondrial membrane function, swollen mitochondria, damaged cristae, decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number, and excessive burden of ROS (Giuseppe and Ross, 2016). Decline in mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular NAD+, ATP levels, decreased NAD +/NADH ratio (Ying, 2008; Zhu et al., 2015), increased NADPH/NADP + ratio (Clement et al., 2018), decreased activity of mitochondrial enzymes, as well as increased oxidative stress, all are observed in older individuals. Data on ATP changes with aging suggests that there is an average decline of 8% per decade in ATP producing capacity in skeletal muscles (Payne and Chinnery, 2015). Mitochondrial DNA mutations and reduced mitophagy lead to an increased share of dysfunctional mitochondrial subclones (Bua et al., 2006; Payne and Chinnery, 2015; Williams et al., 2013; Yu-Wai-Man et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2012), which is involved in a number of pathological processes, including macular degeneration (Karunadharma et al., 2010) and muscle aging (Brierley et al., 1998). Mitochondrial biogenesis is progressively impaired in aging. This includes decline in the number of mitochondria per cell, pathologic morphology and physiology, as well as functional changes (Bianchi et al., 2013; Peterson et al., 2012; Vega et al., 2015). Decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis in aging is aﬀected by various types of damage and mitochondrial defects. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, and age-related decline in its activators, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1), NO and cGMP, or PGC-1α downstream eﬀectors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1) and Nuclear Respiratory Factor 2 (NRF2), can improve mitochondrial output (Suliman and Piantadosi, 2016). Induction of cellular tumor antigen p53 by cellular stress, including telomere attrition, compromises mitochondrial biogenesis aﬀecting negatively PGC-1α (Sui et al., 2016). Mitochondrial dysfunctions and subsequent cellular apoptosis can be caused by cell damage, calcium ions (Ca2+) (Giorgi et al., 2015), ROS signalling, IR and obesity (Ptitsyn et al., 2006), excess free fatty acids (FFAs) (Di Paola and Lorusso, 2006), or misfolded proteins (Baud et al., 2013; Payne and Chinnery, 2015). NAD+ deﬁciency is mediated at least partially by an increase in CD38 protein expression, which can be induced by inﬂammation, toxins (Chini et al., 2018), ROS, and endogenous vasoconstrictors (Lee et al., 2015). Overactivation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) due to DNA damage and repair can also reduce NAD+ levels. Age-related reductions in nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) levels is another possible source of NAD+ deﬁciency (Chini et al., 2018). ATP shortage is associated with muscle (Marzetti et al., 2013) and cardiac (Yaniv et al., 2013) aging, and possibly with proteostasis failures (Brehme et al., 2014). Aging-related defects of mitochondrial respiration include pathological changes in the turnover of ROS, that are naturally occurring byproducts of mitochondrial metabolism. They also play a role in immune defense and act as signaling molecules. At the same time, oxidative stress plays signiﬁcant roles in aging, many of which have yet to be investigated. However, some pro-longevity interventions, such as physical exercise (Radak et al., 2013) or caloric restriction (Nisoli et al., 2005) lead to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and, as a result, higher ROS levels, which is, however, combined with improved antioxidant defense. Therefore, dysregulated ROS metabolism, including the impairment of antioxidant defense and oxidation product clearance systems lead to the increased ROS burden (Guest et al., 2014; Massudi et al., 2012) and health deterioration seen in aging (Payne and Chinnery, 2015). ROS are implicated in the development of cardiovascular (Gracia et al., 2017; Puca et al., 2013) and neurodegenerative diseases (Kim et al., 2015a), aging of cartilage tissues (Ye et al., 2017), liver (Zhang et al., 2014a) and bladder (Camões et al., 2015), ﬁbrosis, cancer (Morry et al., 2017) as well as fertility decline in men (Gunes et al., 2016) and women (Briley et al., 2016). The burden of ROS, inﬂammation, cellular senescence (Calhoun et al., 2016), immune senescence, oxidative stress (Lowery et al., 2013), and misfolded protein damage (Baud et al., 2013) all promote the induction of mitochondrial transition pore permeability. Mitochondrial membrane impairment causes inadequate Ca2+ signalling, which leads to cell apoptosis and contributes to the development of cardiac (Dai et al., 2012), neurodegenerative (Liao et al., 2017), muscular, cardiac (Dai et al., 2012), and eye (Gauthier and Liu, 2017) pathologies. Estrogen aﬀects mitochondria breathing chain through the estrogen receptors and NRF1, and is an important cofactor of mitochondrial antioxidant defense, and it is thought to be the main reason of relatively higher lifespan in females (Viña et al., 2005). Estrogen levels’ decrease in women after menopause has signiﬁcant deteriorating health eﬀects (Jones and Boelaert, 2015). A number of mitochondrially addressed interventions may ameliorate aging-relation conditions. Exercise (Wang et al., 2011), sildenaﬁl (Li et al., 2018), quercetin (Nieman et al., 2010) and epicatechin (Ramirez-Sanchez et al., 2013) supplementation may improve mitochondrial biogenesis. Nicotinamide riboside supplementation improves NAD + blood levels (Airhart et al., 2017; Trammell et al., 2016; Yoshino et al., 2018), while its clinical relevance is being investigated. There is some promising evidence for a direct eﬀect of the NAD+ precursor acipimox on muscle mitochondrial function in humans including increased insulin sensitivity, and increased mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscles (van de Weijer et al., 2015). Additionally, acipimox can reduce plasma glucose, improve blood lipid proﬁle, prevent cardiac parasympathetic modulation in hypopituitary men (Vestergaard, 2017). A number of antioxidant interventions are eﬀective in reducing mortality in some groups of patients, including glucosamine and chondroitin (Katoh et al., 2017), CoQ10 (Alehagen et al., 2018), pentoxifylline (McCarty et al., 2016), NAC (Darweesh et al., 2017), melatonin (Raygan et al., 2017), edaravone (Okada et al., 2018), SGLT2 inhibitors (Fatima et al., 2017; Shigiyama et al., 2017), anti-RAAS drugs (Baykal et al., 2003), curcumin (Tabrizi et al., 2018b), resveratrol (Tabrizi et al., 2018a) and olive oil phenols (Fabiani, 2016). Melatonin reduces cancer mortality (Seely et al., 2012). Other promising anti-oxidant interventions include MitoQ (Rossman et al., 2018), carnosine (Regazzoni et al., 2016), and the intake of polyphenols like ﬂavonoids, such as quercetin (Askari et al., 2012), procyanidins (Li et al., 2015), and stilbenes (Reinisalo et al., 2015). Coﬀee consumption (Martini et al., 2016), vitamin D (Farrokhian et al., 2017), S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (Loguercio et al., 1994), glucosamine (Katoh et al., 2017) also have antioxidant eﬀects. Statin use has ambivalent eﬀects on mitochondrial metabolism (Bouitbir et al., 2012). Interestingly, mitochondrial transplantation has not only shown promising results in animal studies, but also has been used in humans to improve assisted reproduction outcomes (Woods and Tilly, 2015). 

3.2.7. Insulin resistance
[Insulin_resistance a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

 Regulation of cellular glucose and other nutrient metabolism is necessary for organismal functionality (López-Otín et al., 2013). Insulin resistance (IR) plays a major role in critical health conditions, such as inﬂammation and starvation. However, impaired insulin sensitivity is a major hallmark and an early sign of aging (Belsky et al., 2015). IR is a pathological condition in which cells fail to respond to insulin normally. Signiﬁcant number of middle-aged and older adults have diabetes or prediabetes (Yip et al., 2017). IR is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular, kidney diseases and all-cause mortality (Chan et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2016b). Diabetes is associated with increased risks of diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, cognitive decline (Cheng et al., 2012), dementia, mobility decline, falls (Lu et al., 2009), and some cancers (Xu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017). It is characterized by impaired glucose utilization, high blood sugar, increased lipolytic activity in fat cells, circulation of FFAs and inappropriate accumulation of lipids, including abdominal and liver fat. Chronic β-cells exposure to FFAs may lead to the loss of insulin response by β-cells, which eventually may become permanent (Mookerjee et al., 2010). A number of factors are associated with IR, including inﬂammation (Park et al., 2014), pro-ﬁbrotic signaling (Lark and Wasserman, 2017), oxidative stress (Drougard et al., 2015), exposure to ectopic lipids such as FFAs and to some misfolded proteins (Blaise et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2015). Excess body weight, lipid accumulation in insulin-targeted organs including skeletal muscles and liver, and hormonal aging are all associated with IR, which can be exacerbated by suboptimal diet, inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle (Shulman, 2014), but also with inﬂammation (Park et al., 2014) and the history of malnutrition (Francis-Emmanuel et al., 2014). Dysfunctions of hypothalamic tissues (Drougard et al., 2015), as well as dysregulated adipokine signaling (Jaganathan et al., 2018) play major roles in IR development. In fact, IR promotes LDL resistances (via proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9)-centered pathways which involves sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1), glucokinase, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1)) (Miao et al., 2015; Wiciński et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). Similarly, impaired fatty acid beta-oxidation is associated with IR. Fatty acid resistance (inadequate fatty acid beta-oxidation) can be triggered by overfeeding, aging-related mitochondrial, adipocyte and/ or hepatocyte dysfunction, as well as by IR (Kim et al., 2006). This results in the elevated plasma FFA levels commonly seen in aging (Pararasa et al., 2015). Increased systemic FFA levels (saturated FFAs in particular) increases the risks of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality and diseases, such as NASH and NADFL, as well as high blood pressure, impaired endothelial cell function, increased inﬂammatory markers, mitochondrial aging (Gaddipati et al., 2010; Pararasa et al., 2015) and renal ﬁbrosis (Kang et al., 2014). Fatty acid resistance involves (in addition to IR) altered signaling of adipokines (Jura and Kozak, 2016), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ), pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4) (Kim et al., 2006), solute carrier family 13 member 5 (mINDY) (Rogina, 2017), FAT3, CD36, and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA (LCFA-CoA) (Pararasa et al., 2015). Elevated plasma triglycerides can result from overeating, IR, general lipid abundance in the organism and high FFA levels (Welty, 2013). Hypertriglyceridemia is involved in the development of NASH (Amir and Czaja, 2011) and pancreatitis, and is associated with increased risks of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Liu et al., 2013). Resistance to the anabolic action of insulin and increased adiposity are directly and mechanically involved in anabolic resistance, i.e. agingassociated decrease in protein synthesis in the presence of adequate amount of protein in food, which results in muscle loss and sarcopenia in older people. Major factors of anabolic resistance include aging, inactivity, obesity (Smeuninx et al., 2017), IR (Cleasby et al., 2016), and inﬂammation (Xia et al., 2017). Therefore, progressive resistance to many essential nutrients such as glucose, lipids and proteins is observed in aging, which is more prominent in inactive or obese older individuals. IR plays a major role in this impaired nutrient sensing. A number of interventions can improve IR providing major health beneﬁts, including exercise (Conn et al., 2014), avoiding prolonged sitting (Benatti and Ried-Larsen, 2015), weight loss (Houmard et al., 2002) and weight-loss inducing interventions (Khera et al., 2018; Silvestre et al., 2018), healthy diets (Schwingshackl et al., 2018a, 2017a), consumption of olive oil (Schwingshackl et al., 2017b), whole grains (Marventano et al., 2017), nuts (Kim et al., 2018c) and coﬀee as well as supplementation with polyphenols, including ﬂavonols (Menezes et al., 2017) and anthocyanins (Yang et al., 2017). Some antidiabetic medications signiﬁcantly reduce all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with diabetes, including metformin (Haukka et al., 2017), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors (Fatima et al., 2017). In fact, metformin use is also associated with cancer-speciﬁc mortality reduction (Haukka et al., 2017). A number of anti-glycemic interventions decreases not only plasma glucose but also triglyceride or FFA levels (Rosenblit, 2016), for example, metformin reduces the levels of plasma FFAs (Castro Cabezas et al., 2012). Other anti-glycemic and anti-triglyceridemic interventions include acipimox (Makimura et al., 2016), ginger (Mazidi et al., 2016), probiotics (Kasińska and Drzewoski, 2015; Wu et al., 2017), berberin (Lan et al., 2015a), vitamin D (Jafari et al., 2016; Poolsup et al., 2016), olive leaf extract (de Bock et al., 2013; Lockyer et al., 2017), magnesium (Verma and Garg, 2017), sildenaﬁl (Ramirez et al., 2015), melatonin (Doosti-Irani et al., 2018), fenugreek (Gong et al., 2016), Salacia (Jeykodi et al., 2016), Tribulus Terrestris (Samani et al., 2016), Astragalus (Tian et al., 2016) and carnosine (de Courten et al., 2016; Menon et al., 2018). 

3.2.8. Aging-related body composition changes 
[Aging-related_body_composition_change a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Aging in humans is associated with a decreased share of lean mass and an increased share of fat body mass, adipose tissue expansion, and ectopic fat deposits in visceral area, muscles, heart, blood vessels, bone marrow, liver, and pancreas. The decline in non-fat cell mass in aging goes together with decreased mass of muscles, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and bones (Manini, 2010). Lung volume and functionality is decreased in older ages (Koch et al., 2011). Age-related decline in maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) results from multiple factors: decreased maximal heart rate and stroke volume, stiﬀening heart muscle ﬁbers, reduced muscle volume and strength, and as well as diminished blood volume (Kim et al., 2016a). Skeletal muscle mass usually contributes up to about 50% of total body weight in young adults in high-income societies and decreases during aging to approximately 25% of total body weight by 75–80 years (Short et al., 2004), Skeletal muscle loss has major negative impact on indicators of whole body mitochondrial capacity, VO2max (Coen et al., 2013; Mathers et al., 2012) and resting metabolic rate (RMR). Skeletal muscle loss was detected in both aged untrained individuals and professional athletes (Kusy and Zieliński, 2014), but it is greatly exacerbated by low physical activity. Modern humans evolved from hunting and gathering societies, where people were used to very high physical activity levels throughout old age. Traditional farmers also have rather high physical activity compared to modern oﬃce workers. Food has never been as abundant as in the last few decades in the developed countries, and human brains are not ﬁtted for rigorous appetite control, as our ancestors had to survive through persistent risks of malnutrition and frequent famines. As a result, humankind faces new challenges with detrimental health eﬀects of sedentary lifestyle and obesity (Kirchengast, 2014). Additionally, aging-related muscle loss is mediated by IR, anabolic resistance, epigenetic reprogramming, and mitochondrial dysfunctions including Complex I dysfunction, reduced ATP synthesis (Su et al., 2015), reduced muscle oxygen consumption (Coen et al., 2013), increased ROS signalling (Doria et al., 2012), diminished Na/K-ATPase, as well as anabolic hormone signalling, muscle denervation (Spendiﬀ et al., 2016), and muscle ﬁbrosis due to TGF-β1 and myostatin signalling (Parker et al., 2017). Reduced volume of skeletal muscles and diminished lung function aﬀect each other negatively during aging (Koch et al., 2011). Numerous population studies have documented an inverse association between lung volume markers (VO2max, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)) and aging-related endpoints including all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cognitive functions, T2D (Zaccardi et al., 2015), and fractures (Kim et al., 2018c; Mathers et al., 2012). In addition to decreased oxygen demand, lung volume can be negatively aﬀected by thoracic cage stiﬀening from rib cage calciﬁcation, age-related kyphosis from osteoporosis, persistent low-grade inﬂammation, proteolytic and oxidant-mediated injury to the lung matrix resulting in the loss of alveolar units, elastin loss, as well as with immune senescence and loss of lung stem cell regenerative capacity (Brandenberger and Mühlfeld, 2017). Aging-related loss of lean body mass can result in either body mass loss or increased share of adipose tissue. Both obesity and being underweight are associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, with low body weight being particularly dangerous in older adults (Global BMI Mortality Collaboration et al., 2016). Diminishing energy expenditures, RMR and physical activity levels lead to lower energy demand. On average, people decrease their caloric consumption during aging, which increases the risks of nutritional deﬁciencies in old age (Giezenaar et al., 2016). Many aging individuals, however, do not adjust their caloric consumption to decreased energy demands which results in weight gain. Age-associated weight gain is a well documented phenomenon typically associated with aging through middle ages (Belsky et al., 2015). Obesity itself has been shown to lead to the various forms of cellular and tissue dysfunctions characteristic of aging, and is associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, including diabetes, CVDs, stroke, cancer, liver diseases, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and depression (Abdelaal et al., 2017). At the same time, aging-related increase in adiposity is causally implicated in age-related inﬂammation, due to inﬂammatory marker overexpression in obese individuals (Hotamisligil et al., 1997; Weisberg et al., 2003). Similarly, aging-related weight gain and obesity are the major factors of IR, leading to further weight gain and insulin insensitivity (Pararasa et al., 2015). A large share of the middle-aged and older overweight individuals persistently try, but fail to control their appetite and food consumption, which might be aggravated by aging-related conditions such as IR, adipokine signalling changes, as well as by reduced signalling of neurotransmitters, including dopamine and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Delgado, 2013). Uncompensated overeating is the major source of aging-related weight gain and obesity. Eating behavior and physical activity are inﬂuenced by various neurotransmitters and changes in their metabolism in aging. Agingrelated decline in physical activity is detrimental to both muscle capacity and insulin tolerance. It is observed not only in older humans, but also in other species. It is determined by aging-related changes in neurotransmitter signalling, including orexin, dopamine, and agoutirelated protein (AGRP) (Knab and Lightfoot, 2010; Manini, 2010; Ruegsegger and Booth, 2017). Similarly, hormones and other neurotransmitters have major eﬀects on appetite and the ability to control food intake, including insulin sensitivity mediator signalling, such as adipokines (Koleva et al., 2013), dopamine, GABA (Delgado, 2013), neuropeptide Y, AGRP (Ferrario et al., 2016), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), and a lot of these signals are diminished or altered in aging (Xu and Xie, 2016). Hypothalamic gliosis and TGF-β signalling is associated with IR and obesity, which implies the role of neurodegeneration in these processes (Dorfman and Thaler, 2015; Schur et al., 2015). Increased adipocyte volume in obese individuals is associated with the inability to store triglycerides, impaired mitochondrial function, alterations in membrane proteins and higher levels of adipocyte cell death and inﬂammation, all of which have causal implications in the development of obesity-related metabolic dysfunction (Heinonen et al., 2014; Maurizi et al., 2018). Larger hypoxic areas of the adipose tissues in combination with its increased proinﬂammatory microenvironment, as seen in age-related increase in adiposity, is further aggravated by IR (Cinti et al., 2005; Kovsan et al., 2011). Aging promotes the shift from subcutaneous and lower body adiposity to visceral fat expansion, which has detrimental metabolic eﬀects, including inﬂammation, IR, cardiovascular diseases (Manini, 2010; Pararasa et al., 2015) and NAFLD (Verrijken et al., 2010). Visceral adipose tissue secretes more pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, promotes IR with lower adiponectin signalling and leads to higher FFA plasma levels due to its lower fat storing capacity compared to subcutaneous fat depot (Manini, 2010; Pararasa et al., 2015). Enlarged visceral adipocytes are associated with dyslipidemia (Hoﬀstedt et al., 2010). Liver fat deposits are the main cause of NAFLD and NASH, contributing to liver ﬁbrosis and cirrhosis. Liver volume decreases by 2040% as a person gets old, predominantly due to functional cell loss (Kim et al., 2015b). Major mechanisms linked to liver fat accumulation include cellular senescence, which leads to impaired liver regeneration, obesity, inﬂammation, hypoxia, IR, and ﬁbrosis (Pararasa et al., 2015). Mitochondrial dysfunctions also promote the hepatic fat expansion, including SIRT1 and NAMPT (Gaddipati et al., 2010) loss and oxidative stress (Masarone et al., 2018). Toxicant exposure and ﬁbrosis can lead to reduced number and size of fenestrations (pores) of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Liver defenestration may lead to an increase in liver fat deposits and impaired lipid processing in the liver (Kim et al., 2015b). Overeating leads to increased plasma lipid levels, and together with oxidative stress and inﬂammation promotes atherosclerosis development. Increased share of fat in bone marrow aﬀects bone health negatively leading to lower bone density with increased risks of osteoporosis and vertebral fractures (Schwartz, 2015). Physical activity, including aerobic and resistance exercise, is at least partly capable of preventing and restoring aging-related loss of muscle mass, energy expenditure (Siparsky et al., 2014), and VO2max (Burtscher, 2013). A number of nutritional supplements have been used to protect muscle mass and function and promote physical activity and mobility in older people, including vitamin D3 (Cleasby et al., 2016), higher caloric content, amino acids, high protein content (Cawood et al., 2012), n-3 fatty acids (Bell et al., 2017), and β-Hydroxy β-Methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine amino acid (Wu et al., 2015b). A high-protein oral nutritional supplement with HMB reduced mortality among malnourished, older, hospitalized adults (Deutz et al., 2016). Testosterone supplementation for men alone or in combination with human growth hormone (GH) might increase muscle mass and decrease fat mass (Giannoulis et al., 2012). However, the safety of these approaches is still a major issue, as pro-anabolic signalling is implicated in the development of aging-related diseases (for example, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and mTOR signalling activated by GH, as well as dihydrotestosterone, a testosterone metabolite, are involved in both normal regenerative processes in neural or muscle tissues, but also in aging and disease development (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017). Another example is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation, which improves body composition in older men (Corona et al., 2013), but whose safety is still not clear. Certain diets can promote weight reduction in overweight individuals, including energy restriction, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean (Mancini et al., 2016), and vegetarian (Huang et al., 2016a) diets, nut and legume consumption (Schwingshackl et al., 2018b). Exercise can also be eﬀective for weight loss if combined with a proper diet (Stoner et al., 2016). A number of pharmacological interventions are eﬀective at preventing, slowing and reversing both weight-gain in general as well as age-related weight gain. Some antidiabetic drugs (in addition to reducing morbidity and mortality) are found to reduce body weight in people with diabetes: metformin, acarbose, miglitol, pramlintide, exenatide, liraglutide (Domecq et al., 2015). The use of liraglutide as an anti-obesity agent is currently studied for long-term health eﬀects (Davies et al., 2018). Resveratrol (Mousavi et al., 2018b), probiotics (Zhang et al., 2015), curcumin (Mousavi et al., 2018a) and ginger (Maharlouei et al., 2018) are somewhat eﬀective for reducing IR and for weight loss, but resveratrol use might increase LDL (Zhao et al., 2019a). Bariatric surgeries provide major weight loss beneﬁts and lead to lower long-term all-cause cardiovascular and cancer mortality among young and middle-aged adults with obesity (Cardoso et al., 2017). Orlistat reduces fat absorption, and consequently, caloric consumption. This results not only in weight loss, but also in improved blood lipid proﬁles (Sahebkar et al., 2017). A number of medicines lead to weight reduction as direct or side eﬀects, aﬀecting neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, GABA, glutamate, and serotonin: phentermine, zonisamide, topiramate, bupropion, ﬂuoxetine, phentermine, lorcaserin (Domecq et al., 2015). Long-term safety of these agents remains to be explored. Phentermine/topiramate controlled-release use was associated with weight loss, improved patients' lipid proﬁles, particularly their levels of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol, insulin sensitivity and glycemia, retarded the progression of T2D (Bays and Gadde, 2011; Kiortsis, 2013), but tended to increase heart rates (Alfaris et al., 2015). Statins signiﬁcantly reduce not only cardiovascular risks but also all-cause mortality in people with dyslipidemia (Naci et al., 2013). Yet, statin use might cause myopathy as a side eﬀect. Lipid-lowering interventions with potential health beneﬁts are berberine (Lan et al., 2015b), ﬂaxseed interventions (Pan et al., 2009), consumption of ginger (Mazidi et al., 2016), olive products (Filip et al., 2015), dietary ﬂavonoid intake (Menezes et al., 2017), and policosanol (Gong et al., 2018). 

3.2.9. Aging-related hormonal changes 
[Aging-related_hormonal_change a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Hormone proﬁles change signiﬁcantly in aging humans, and many of these changes are clinically signiﬁcant, leading to health impairment and frailty. Aging brings reduced production of sex hormones, which leads to physiologic changes: reduced muscle mass, energy, and exercise capacity, bone loss, increased risks of AD (Jones and Boelaert, 2015; Uchoa et al., 2016) and decline in sexual function (Williams and Cho, 2017). Aging-related estrogen loss is especially pronounced in women after menopause, which has direct detrimental health eﬀects. Estrogen receptors are important transcriptional factors regulating pathways of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which might partly explain lower mortality in females compared to males (Austad and Fischer, 2016). A later age of natural menopause (ANM) correlates with lower allcause mortality (2% with each increasing year of ANM), decreased risk of CVD, atherosclerosis, stroke and osteoporosis (Schoenaker et al., 2014). These beneﬁts seem to outweigh side eﬀects such as a moderate increase in breast and ovarian cancer risks (Day et al., 2015; Schoenaker et al., 2014). Menopause-related estrogen loss increases cardiovascular risk factors, such as endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia, hypertension, IR, hypercoagulability, and pro-inﬂammatory state. It also increases risks of osteoporosis (Jones and Boelaert, 2015), and leads to changes in body composition, neurodegeneration (Uchoa et al., 2016) and optic nerve aging (Dewundara et al., 2016). Low levels of endogenous testosterone in older men are associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Araujo et al., 2011) and AD (Lv et al., 2016), as well as higher fat mass (Bann et al., 2015), metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, renal failure, frailty, malignancy and cardiovascular events (Shores and Matsumoto, 2014). The blood levels of DHEA and its metabolite dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAs) decrease in aging. Low DHEA and DHEAs levels in older people are associated with increased risks of mortality (Rosero-Bixby and Dow, 2012), frailty (Tajar et al., 2011), depression, T2D and AD (Jones and Boelaert, 2015). In summary, reduced sex hormone metabolism is associated with generally poorer health in aging individuals. Aging inﬂuences many aspects of complex hormonal system. The cells and tissues of the neuroendocrine glands, including hypothalamus, a brain structure that controls the other structures in the endocrine system, are aﬀected by aging-related neurodegenerative processes. In turn, neural aging is driven by pathological processes like neuroinﬂammation, microglia excessive activation, cellular senescence (Ojo et al., 2015), mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, accelerated neuronal apoptosis, impaired neurogenesis, neurovascular aging, gliosis, and IR (Hardeland et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016). Impaired proteostasis, including impaired amyloid processing, exacerbates neural aging, including the aging of neuroendocrine organs reducing brain neurosteroid synthesis among other things (Barron and Pike, 2012). There is preclinical data that inﬂammatory signalling, such as TNFα, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK-β) and NF-κB, impairs hypothalamic neurogenesis leading to aging-related decline in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signalling (Zhang et al., 2013). Hypothalamic gliosis is associated with IR and obesity (Schur et al., 2015), which could be signs of inﬂammatory response (Dorfman and Thaler, 2015; Schur et al., 2015). Hypothalamic aging results in decrease and dysregulation of GnRH pulsations (Veldhuis et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2013), which can be detrimental for sex hormone metabolism. In fact, about 85% of male hypogonadism cases are secondary in the sense that the testes are being insuﬃciently stimulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (McCullough, 2015). Also, neurodegeneration of hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus is involved in reduced melatonin metabolism, which causes sleep disturbances and deprives aging human organisms of multiple beneﬁts of melatonin, including anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant defense and bone health support (Hardeland et al., 2015). In addition, the size of melatonin-producing pineal gland decreases in aging. At the same time, human gonads (testes and ovaries) are aﬀected by aging as well. Aging testicular tissues undergo volume loss, IR, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunctions, hypoxia and ﬁbrosis. Testosteroneproducing Leydig cells suﬀer from mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress resulting in reduced steroidogenesis (Wang et al., 2017). They decrease in quantity, which plays a role in aging-related reduction in androgen levels (Gunes et al., 2016). Menopause involves follicular dysfunctions and depletion, as well as hypothalamic function alterations. The number of primordial follicles rapidly declines with time. About 1 million oocytes are present at birth in the human ovary, about 400,000 follicles are present at puberty, and only about 500 (about 0.05%) ovulate, while the rest are wasted (Wilkosz et al., 2014). Decreased number and function of follicular granulosa cells results in decreased estrogen and inhibin B secretion. This leads to increased GnRH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion during early stage of menopause (Harlow et al., 2012). Additionally, the signaling of hypothalamic GnRH-promoting peptide kisspeptin is signiﬁcantly increased with women’s age which accelerates menopause (Day et al., 2015). FSH promotes growth and recruitment of immature ovarian follicles, which ultimately accelerates their depletion, leading to menopause (Day et al., 2015). Primordial and small follicle loss with aging results in the loss of inhibin B and Anti-Müllerian hormone, as they are secreted by smaller, less developed follicles (Rojas et al., 2015). This results in accelerated oocyte development to a more mature state which makes them more prone to apoptosis and follicular atresia. Depletion of follicles leads to signiﬁcant decrease in androgen and estrogen production, declining fertility and ultimately menopause. GnRH secretion is diminished during late postmenopause (Harlow et al., 2012). Oocytes suﬀer from reduced oxidative defense, mitochondrial dysfunctions, telomere attrition, lipotoxicity (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2017; Keefe et al., 2015), AGEs, and DNA damage (Wilding, 2015). Ovarian DNA damage repair system deteriorates with age, as its principal agent breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) is progressively lost in aging (Oktay et al., 2015) which is related to menopause (Day et al., 2015). Additionally, ovarian stromal cells and adjusting tissues undergo cellular senescence which leads to increased inﬂammatory signalling, tumorigenic propensity (Shan and Liu, 2009), and ovarian stromal ﬁbrosis (Briley et al., 2016). Testosterone replacement therapy improves health, quality of life and reduces all-cause mortality in men with hypogonadism (Hackett, 2016). It has beneﬁts in terms of sexual and physical functioning, mood, and depressive symptoms, however, its long-term safety needs to be evaluated in large clinical trials (Snyder et al., 2016). At the same time, recreational anabolic steroid use by young men leads to prolonged decrease of endogenous serum testosterone levels (Christou et al., 2017). There is early clinical data on hypogonadism treatments, capable of restoring endogenous testosterone production in men, including human chorionic gonadotropin, clomiphene citrate, and some aromatase inhibitors (McCullough, 2015). Certain preparations of HRT may provide signiﬁcant symptom-reducing beneﬁts for younger healthy postmenopausal women (50–60 years old). The beneﬁts include a reduction in all-cause mortality, coronary health disease and osteoporotic fractures. At the same time, certain HRT regimes can increase risks of breast, ovarian and uterine cancers, and thrombotic events, which limits HRT use (Lobo, 2017). Further clinical studies are needed. Nulliparity, vegetarian diet, smoking, high polyunsaturated fat intake, and excessive exercise consistently correlate with earlier age at natural menopause. Higher BMI, higher intake of total fat, protein, and meat, dietary vitamin D and calcium intake, as well as moderate physical activity and exercise delay the age at natural menopause (Sapre and Thakur, 2014). Coenzyme Q10 supplementation might preserve female fertility, but further research is needed (Gretchen Garbe Collins, 2015). 

3.2.10. Cardiovascular aging 
[Cardiovascular_aging a:AgingPathogeneticProcess]

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major cause of aging-related morbidity and mortality. Ideal cardiovascular health metrics are associated with a 46% lower all-cause mortality compared to people with the worst indicators (Guo and Zhang, 2017). By delivering oxygenated blood to all tissues in the body, the cardiovascular system plays a vital role in the health and longevity of the organism as a whole. Accumulation of cardiovascular system dysfunctions can make cardiovascular system a major driver of pathological processes in an aging individual. Therefore, we denote cardiovascular aging as a separate and major causal process in aging pathogenesis. Thus, peripheral artery disease can lead to stroke, renovascular hypertension, renal dysfunctions, mesenteric ischemia, ischemia in lower and upper extremities (Aboyans et al., 2018). Cerebrovascular dysfunctions are major risk factors for stroke, dementia, cognitive decline, and neural aging (Toth et al., 2017). Vascular aging and diseases are involved in the pathogenesis of eye diseases, including macular degeneration, Schnabel cavernous degeneration, and possibly, presbyopia (Pescosolido et al., 2016), as well as loss of hearing (Kurata et al., 2016) and taste sensitivity (which could lead to malnutrition in old age) (Pavlidis et al., 2013). Microvascular damage is involved in many pathological processes, including neural, myocardial, lung, kidney, colon, skin (Ambrose, 2017), and tendon aging (McCarthy and Hannaﬁn, 2014). Also, vascular damage is a major cause of erectile dysfunction (El-Sakka, 2011). Aging has a remarkable eﬀect on the heart and vascular system, leading to the increase in CVD incidence including ischemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Cardiovascular ﬁtness (measured, for example, by VO2max) declines in aging adults, especially in people with low physical activity (Burtscher, 2013). Cardiac and vascular, in particular, arterial wall remodeling, stiffening and ﬁbrosis seem to be major processes contributing to aging pathogenesis as a whole. Vascular remodelling sincludes irreversible degradation of elastic ﬁber in the blood vessel walls, collagen deposition and cross-linking, blood vessel wall thickening, amyloid deposition in the medial layer, and migration/proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells to the intima. Heart aging can be exacerbated by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, altered LV diastolic function, diminished LV systolic reserve capacity, increased arterial stiﬀness, impaired endothelial function and cardiac rhythm disturbances (North and Sinclair, 2012). Cardiovascular aging is exacerbated by hypertension, dyslipidemias, ischemia, reduced vascular perfusion (Ungvari et al., 2018), and altered noradrenergic vascular innervation (Hunter et al., 2012). It is clear that low physical activity greatly contributes to endothelial dysfunction and aggravates cardiovascular aging (de Almeida et al., 2017). There is evidence of people from a few modern huntergatherer and forager-horticulturalist societies having unusually low prevalence of atherosclerosis implying a major role of lifestyle in cardiovascular aging (Kaplan et al., 2017; Lemogoum et al., 2012). Both menopause and hypogonadism have particular detrimental eﬀects on cardiovascular health (Jones and Boelaert, 2015). The pathological processes of cardiovascular aging are driven by mechanical stress in the blood vessel walls, exacerbated by hypertension and RAAS activation, pro-inﬂammatory, pro-ﬁbrotic (TGF-β) and proteolytic (MMP-12) signalling, cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, IR, immune senescence (Yu et al., 2017), as well as by misfolded proteins such as amyloids, AGEs, AOPPs, and elastin peptides (Hunter et al., 2012; Ungvari et al., 2018). Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis involves dysregulated cholesterol metabolism, oxidation of TG-rich lipoproteins, cellular senescence, inﬂammation (IL-1, TNF-α, IL-6 pathways) (Ridker and Lüscher, 2014), and mitochondrial dysfunctions (Ungvari et al., 2018). Dysfunctional calcium signalling may lead to both excessive cellular apoptosis and blood vessel calciﬁcation. Vitamin D deﬁciency is associated with higher all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality, respectively (Chowdhury et al., 2014). Dysregulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and processing occurs with age and in the context of CVDs due to inﬂammation and oxidative stress (Ungvari et al., 2018). A number of interventions are eﬀective for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular aging, diseases, as well as of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Physical activity and exercise, as well as reducing daily sitting time, have major potentials in primary and secondary prevention of CVDs (Alves et al., 2016), and some cancers (Kruk and Czerniak, 2013). Healthier dietary patterns are associated with decreased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, including whole-grain food, fruit, vegetable, nut, legume, and ﬁsh consumption, certain polyphenols (Kim et al., 2018c; Rienks et al., 2017), moderate coﬀee intake (Zhao et al., 2015), and possibly olive oil (Schwingshackl and Hoﬀmann, 2014). Excessive consumption of red meat, especially processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages have negative health eﬀects (Bechthold et al., 2017; Schwingshackl et al., 2017c). Similar associations are observed for cancer risks (Bella et al., 2017).
Anti-hypertensive drugs reduce not only blood pressure, but also allcause mortality, CVD events, stroke, and heart failure in people with hypertension (Ettehad et al., 2016), as well as retinopathy progression (Xie et al., 2016). Statin use in people at increased CVD risks (Chou et al., 2016), as well as the use of some antidiabetic medications in people with T2D (Haukka et al., 2017), such as metformin (Campbell et al., 2017), GLP-1 agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Fatima et al., 2017). Statin use might also decrease some (Mei et al., 2017) cancer risks. Certain preparations of hormone replacement therapy, including parenteral estrogen therapy for younger postmenopausal women (Lobo, 2017), as well as, possibly, long-acting testosterone injection supplementation for men with hypogonadism (Hackett, 2016) reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Some anti-inﬂammatory treatments reduce both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, including aspirin (Sutcliﬀe et al., 2013). Glucosamine and chondroitin supplementation, in addition to being used as anti-osteoarthritic remedy, is associated with reduced all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and respiratory mortality (Bell et al., 2012) as well as possibly colorectal (Ibáñez-Sanz et al., 2018; Kantor et al., 2016) and lung cancer (Brasky et al., 2011) incidence. Glucosamine use might also improve endothelial function (Katoh et al., 2017). Bisphosphonate use improves calcium metabolism and may reduce cardiovascular, all-cause and cancer mortality in patients with osteoporosis (Kranenburg et al., 2016; Van Acker et al., 2016), although the eﬀect on all-cause mortality was recently challenged (Cummings et al., 2019). Some data suggests that low dose vitamin D3 supplementation without calcium might reduce blood pressure (Golzarand et al., 2016), but there is currently not enough data supporting cardioprotective effects of vitamin D supplementation to make any strong conclusions, partly due to the lack of clinical trials in people with vitamin D deﬁciency with regular administration of various doses of vitamin D3, and not combined with calcium. At the same time, cohort studies of Swedish women (Yang et al., 2011), as well as of some patient groups (Ho et al., 2014; Shapiro et al., 2014) imply that sun exposure can be protective against cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, as well as some agingrelated diseases, despite the increased skin cancer incidence (Hoel et al., 2016; Lindqvist and Landin-Olsson, 2017). High dietary magnesium intake is associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Fang et al., 2016). Magnesium aﬀects homeostasis of both calcium and vitamin D. There seems to be an optimal ratio between calcium and magnesium intake, and suboptimal levels of this ratio (Rosanoﬀ et al., 2016) disturb metabolism and accelerate certain aging-related diseases. Magnesium supplementation may decrease CVD risk factors (Verma and Garg, 2017). CoQ10 supplementation decreased mortality and improves exercise capacity in patients with heart failure (Li and Yan, 2017). NAC may signiﬁcantly ameliorate the consequences of myocardial Infarction (Pasupathy et al., 2017). Interventions boosting cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), an ATP derivative, including PDE inhibitors including PDE5 inhibitors (Andersson et al., 2017; De Vecchis et al., 2017), pentoxifylline (Champion et al., 2014) and coﬀee intake (Poole et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2015), compensate for ATP deﬁciencies and could reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality at least in some groups of people. 

3.2.11. Other mechanisms of aging

Aging is obviously not conﬁned to the pathological processes described above. We identiﬁed several other mechanisms of aging throughout the course of our research literature review. This includes DNA damage, including DNA lesions such as mutations, translocations, chromosomal gains and losses, telomere shortening, and gene disruptions caused by the integration of viruses or transposons (López-Otín et al., 2013). DNA damage has clinically important eﬀects in many types of aging cells and tissues, including stem cells (Franco et al., 2018; Jaiswal et al., 2017; Weakley et al., 2010), as well as oocytes (White and Vijg, 2016) and spermatozoa (Gunes et al., 2016) contributing to aging-related fertility loss. DNA damage is a major cause of cancer and in some cases of CVD (Jaiswal et al., 2017) development. Aging-related epigenetic changes are also a major issue aﬀecting directly or indirectly every hallmark of aging. This includes heterochromatin loss, the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, changes in global DNA methylation, histone loss and histone code modiﬁcations, and alterations in biogenesis and functions of non-coding RNA (Gangisetty et al., 2018; Pal and Tyler, 2016). Changes of calcium metabolism in aging seem to be an important albeit a complex (Cohen et al., 2018) issue as a number of interventions improving calcium metabolism reduce all-cause mortality in aged people (Fang et al., 2016; Golzarand et al., 2016; Kranenburg et al., 2016; Van Acker et al., 2016). Aging-related pathologies include calcium bone loss in osteoporosis, and vascular calciﬁcation, which are correlated, at least in women (Zhang and Feng, 2017). On the other hand, dysregulated calcium signalling is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases of aging (Pchitskaya et al., 2018). Finally, in addition to cardiovascular aging, aging of some other key body organs and systems can drive the cascades of pathological processes in organism as a whole. This includes aging-related damage to liver, kidney, and nervous system. Similarly, stem cell exhaustion in aging is another important issue driven by mitochondrial dysfunctions (Zhang et al., 2018a), cellular senescence (Sui et al., 2016), DNA damage (Beerman et al., 2014; Jaiswal et al., 2017), epigenetic changes, as well as negative changes in the stem cell niches, including pro-inﬂammatory signalling and ROS (Chen et al., 2017a). Yet, the complexity of aging does not seem to be indeﬁnite, as it can be described in terms of a number of pathological processes, which can be in many cases addressed therapeutically to the overall beneﬁt of the patient. We mapped connections between the major clinically signiﬁcant pathogenetic processes of aging in humans identiﬁed in this article from the current medical research literature which we described in the earlier sections of the article (Fig. 1). 3.3. Course and outcome: a distinct pattern of development over time Aging-related pathologies are of chronic nature. They may be alleviated but they do not vanish in their complexity. Many biomarkers change consistently as people age, but some have non-linear relationships with calendar age (Yashin et al., 2010) due to changes in nutrient sensing described above. These changes in metabolism and pharmacodynamics are clinically important factors that can be used to identify speciﬁc stages of aging, which might include aging in young adults (2540 y.o.) (Belsky et al., 2015), middle-aged (40-60 y.o.), youngest old (60-69 y.o.), oldest old (80 years and older) (Forman et al., 1992), (Lehallier et al., 2019), as well as centenarians and supercentenarians. Aging may ultimately result in death even in the absence of major underlying diseases (causes of death). 

[Death subclass-of:owl/Thing]
[CauseOfDeath subclass-of:owl/Thing]

At least some centenarians die without speciﬁc major diagnosed diseases as underlying causes of death (Bernstein et al., 2004; Meslé and Vallin, 2017). About 10% of supercentenarians survive until the last 3 months of life without major agerelated diseases (Andersen et al., 2012). For many of centenarians old age or senility (Chen et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2014; Meslé and Vallin, 2017) was recorded as the underlying cause of death which may be explained by the combined eﬀects of aging-related deﬁcits leading to general health deterioration in this group (Chen et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2014; Meslé and Vallin, 2017). This adds to the observation that pathological eﬀects of aging cannot be entirely explained by ill eﬀects of aging-related diseases. 3.4. Treatment response: a known pattern of response to interventions We identiﬁed and described above a number of interventions which can reduce the symptoms of the major aging-related pathological processes. Some of them are also eﬀective against aging-related diseases, while some reduce all-cause mortality in large population groups (Table 1). Physical activity stands out as a nearly universal anti-aging cure, in that it ameliorates most of the aging-related pathological processes surveyed here (Alves et al., 2016; Arem et al., 2015; Duggal et al., 2018; Kruk and Czerniak, 2013; Mundstock et al., 2015; Rahman and Adjeroh, 2019). Healthy diets (Bechthold et al., 2017; Mancini et al., 2016; Raﬁe et al., 2017; Schwingshackl et al., 2018a, 2018b, 2017a, 2017c; Soltani et al., 2017), high in ﬂavonoids (Kim et al., 2018c; Rienks et al., 2017), olive oil (Schwingshackl et al., 2017b, 2015; Schwingshackl and Hoﬀmann, 2014), coﬀee (Liu et al., 2015; Martini et al., 2016; Poole et al., 2017; Zhang and Zhang, 2018; Zhao et al., 2015), nuts (Kim et al., 2018b), legumes (Schwingshackl et al., 2017c), whole grain products (Marventano et al., 2017; Rienks et al., 2017) and magnesium (Fang et al., 2016; Rosanoﬀ et al., 2016; Simental-Mendia et al., 2017; Verma and Garg, 2017). Vitamin D and magnesium supplementation in people with such mineral deﬁciencies also seem to have broad-spectrum antiaging eﬀects (Chowdhury et al., 2014; Farrokhian et al., 2017; Mirhosseini et al., 2018). Aspirin seems to be another anti-aging drug for the eligible patients (Richman and Owens, 2017; Sutcliﬀe et al., 2013; Whitlock et al., 2015). A number of drugs need to be tested as promising anti-aging interventions in large clinical trials. CoQ10 ameliorates some aging-related pathological processes and may improve survival in patients with heart failure (Alehagen et al., 2018; Lehagen et al., 2018; Li and Yan, 2017; Zhai et al., 2017). Therefore, it might work as an anti-aging drug, although more research in people without heart failure is needed. Some antidiabetic drugs, such as metformin (Castro Cabezas et al., 2012; de Kreutzenberg et al., 2015; Domecq et al., 2015; Haukka et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2015a), GLP-1 agonists (Fatima et al., 2017) and SGLT2 inhibitors (Bekki et al., 2018; Fatima et al., 2017; Shigiyama et al., 2017) provide anti-aging beneﬁts and extend lifespan and healthspan in people with diabetes and are tested for other conditions. RAAS blocking drugs (Kim et al., 2016b; Wu et al., 2015a) act as antiaging interventions in patients with hypertension, but they are also used against ﬁbrotic diseases. Statin use addresses some (but not all) pathological processes of aging and reduces all-cause mortality, at least in some groups of people (e.g. those with dyslipidemia) (Boccardi et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2014, 2016; Geifman et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017a; Naci et al., 2013; Paradisi et al., 2012; Riekse et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2017). The use of bisphosphonates improves survival in cancer patients with beneﬁts generally outweighing the risks (Van Acker et al., 2016), and may reduce all-cause mortality in patients with osteoporosis (Kranenburg et al., 2016) although this ﬁnding was challenges recently (Cummings et al., 2019). Pentoxifylline (a PDE-3 inhibitor) may have anti-aging properties (Champion et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2017c; McCarty et al., 2016; Pollice et al., 2001; Wen et al., 2017), but more clinical trials on diﬀerent indications are needed. Interestingly, PDE-5 inhibitors in addition to treating erectile dysfunction might have anti-aging eﬀects in people with a number of aging-related conditions like T2D (Anderson et al., 2016) and heart failure (De Vecchis et al., 2017). Glucosamine and chondroitin use also seems to act as an anti-aging compound in its users (people with osteoarthritis) (Bell et al., 2012; Katoh et al., 2017; Navarro et al., 2015). Other promising but less studied interventions include N-acetylcysteine (Ahmadi et al., 2017; Chughlay et al., 2016; Firuzi et al., 2011; Talasaz et al., 2014), carnosine and close compounds (Babizhayev et al., 2012; Babizhayev and Yegorov, 2016; de Courten et al., 2016; Hisatsune et al., 2016; Menon et al., 2018; Regazzoni et al., 2016), melatonin (Akbari et al., 2018; Doosti-Irani et al., 2018; Hardeland et al., 2015; Raygan et al., 2017; Seely et al., 2012), NADinducing substances including acipimox (Airhart et al., 2017; Trammell et al., 2016; van de Weijer et al., 2015; Yoshino et al., 2018), probiotics (Kasińska and Drzewoski, 2015; Lei et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015), as well as plant-based quercetin (Askari et al., 2012; Byun et al., 2017; Justice et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2016; Mohammadi-Sartang et al., 2017; Nenna et al., 2015; Nieman et al., 2010; Sahebkar, 2017; Serban et al., 2016), resveratrol (Chilelli et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017; Mousavi et al., 2018b; Tabrizi et al., 2018a; Zhao et al., 2019a), berberine (Lan et al., 2015a), ginger (Maharlouei et al., 2018; Mazidi et al., 2016), turmeric and curcumin (Chilelli et al., 2016; Mousavi et al., 2018a; Tabrizi et al., 2018b), astragalus (Dow and Harley, 2016; He et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2009), and olive-based products (de Bock et al., 2013; Fabiani, 2016; Filip et al., 2015; Lockyer et al., 2017; Menicacci et al., 2017). Certain regimes of HRT for post-menopausal women and men with hypogonadism might have anti-aging eﬀects (Lobo, 2017; Marjoribanks et al., 2017), but more research is needed. Bariatric surgeries may prevent pathologies of aging in people with obesity (Cardoso et al., 2017). This list is obviously incomplete, and it can be completed in the future as geroprotectors identiﬁed in animal models will be tested in humans (Moskalev et al., 2017), as well as with new clinical studies of other interventions. So far we can generally conclude that the rate of human aging does respond to interventions, both in general population and patients with certain diseases. 

3.5. Linkage to genetic factors: e.g., genotypes, patterns of gene expression 

So far, only a few gene variants consistently associated with longevity in diﬀerent ethnic groups have been identiﬁed (Dato et al., 2019). Many of them are related to aging-related pathological processes, including APOE (proteostasis, lipid metabolism) (Deelen et al., 2019), FOXO3A, G vs T alleles, rs2802292 (defense against oxidative stress, telomere length (Davy et al., 2018), cell survival, cardiovascular health, etc.), KLOTHO KL-VS (calcium homeostasis, insulin sensitivity) (Revelas et al., 2018), CDKN2A/B (cellular senescence) (Deelen et al., 2019), IL-6 (inﬂammation) (Deelen et al., 2019), and rs2149954 on chromosome 5q33.3 (cardiovascular health) (Nygaard et al., 2017). The role of other longevity-associated gene variants remains to be fully understood, i.e. rs7676745, located on chromosome 4 near GPR78 (Deelen et al., 2019). Interestingly, growth hormone receptor exon 3 deletion is associated with longevity in men (Ben-Avraham et al., 2017). Studies in some speciﬁc groups reveal other interesting longevity gene candidates potentially relevant for new therapy development. Thus, a study of longevity among Amish community identiﬁed that carriers of the null SERPINE1 allele had a longer lifespan (Khan et al., 2017). Studies in California identiﬁed a relationship between longevity and dopamine D4 receptor DRD4 gene (Grady et al., 2013; Szekely et al., 2016) which may be due to neural system metabolism in old age (Volkow et al., 2013). Genetic studies of the multi-ethnic oldest-old populations reveal the importance of DNA repair and proteostasis mechanisms which may be encoded by diﬀerent gene variants (Kim et al., 2018b). Hopefully, further genetic research will identify more gene variants related to longevity which will help to identify pro-longevity clinical strategies. Aging is associated with signiﬁcant aging-related epigenetic changes (de Magalhães et al., 2009; Gopalan et al., 2017; Jung et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Pal and Tyler, 2016; Salas-Pérez et al., 2019), but their clinical signiﬁcance, as discussed earlier, remains currently to be fully understood. 

3.6. Linkage to interacting environmental factor 

Environmental factors have large-scale eﬀects on the rate of aging. In fact, a safer environment with better food security and pathogen control has allowed modern humans to achieve higher life expectancy levels than ever before. A systematic review of behavioral and metabolic risk factors of disability-adjusted years of life lost identiﬁed poor control of high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking and high BMI as major risk factors globally, each of them being a signiﬁcant factor of accelerated aging as discussed above (GBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborators, 2018). In fact, smoking is a major risk factor of agingassociated diseases, all-cause mortality (Mons et al., 2015) and accelerated aging (Mamoshina et al., 2019). Socioeconomic status is associated with higher life expectancy (Stringhini et al., 2017). Also, education is negatively associated with the risks of non-communicable diseases other than neoplastic diseases (Smith et al., 2015). Education, smoking, BMI, alcohol intake, and physical activity are correlated with biomarkers of epigenetic aging (Fiorito et al., 2019). Certain work conditions, such as night-shift work (Lin et al., 2015), strenuous occupational physical activity (Coenen et al., 2018) or prolonged occupational sitting (Kikuchi et al., 2015) might impede health and accelerate aging. Environmental toxic pollution is associated with increased mortality from aging-related diseases (Chowdhury et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2019). Social engagement (Rico-Uribe et al., 2018), meaningful work, and volunteering (Anderson et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2016) are associated with improved survival. Characteristics of a neighborhood and built-in environment may aﬀect health in older ages (Malambo et al., 2016). A highly-walkable or mountain environment predisposes individuals to physical activity and longevity (Pes et al., 2013). Therefore, aging can be attenuated, and healthy longevity maintained via various modiﬁcations of the environment through the lifecourse. 

{Discussion}
4. Discussion 

Our review is obviously not comprehensive and should be further developed. However, it does represent the ﬁrst systematic approach to implementing aging in the ICD. Using the WHO’s criteria for disease classiﬁcation, we conclude that aging generally ﬁts all of them, and therefore can be considered a disease. We identiﬁed pathogenetic processes common for aging of diﬀerent organs and systems of the human body, according to the current state of medical research. The major ones include aging-related low-grade systemic inﬂammation, replicative cellular senescence, proteostasis failures, immunosenescence, mitochondrial dysfunctions, increased ﬁbrotic propensity, insulin resistance, body composition changes and hormonal changes in aging. Aging of some human body systems and organs, including cardiovascular, gastroenterological, neural and kidney aging, leads to the rise of secondary pathogenetic cascades of aging which can harm the aging organism as a whole. These identiﬁed pathogenetic processes aﬀect many human body organs and systems. We mapped connections between various pathogenetic processes of aging which were described in the relevant sections of this study above and summarized them in Fig. 1. The analysis of pathogenetic mechanisms of aging shows their high degree of interconnection, which presents aging as a complex but a holistic process. Immune senescence and some aspects of hormonal aging stand out to some extent as less connected to other components of aging, which makes them less susceptible to therapeutic interventions. Unlike some previous systematic studies of aging (de Grey and Rae, 2007; López-Otín et al., 2013), our review was almost completely conﬁned to human studies. Our results are rather similar to these authors, which reﬂects growing understanding and consensus on the mechanisms of aging within the scientiﬁc community. Interestingly, our study has identiﬁed aging-related increased ﬁbrotic propensity as an asyet unrecognized hallmark of aging, in addition to traditionally control has allowed modern humans to achieve higher life expectancy levels than ever before. A systematic review of behavioral and metabolic risk factors of disability-adjusted years of life lost identiﬁed poor control of high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, smoking and high BMI as major risk factors globally, each of them being a signiﬁcant factor of accelerated aging as discussed above (GBD 2017 Risk Factor Collaborators, 2018). In fact, smoking is a major risk factor of agingassociated diseases, all-cause mortality (Mons et al., 2015) and accelerated aging (Mamoshina et al., 2019). Socioeconomic status is associated with higher life expectancy (Stringhini et al., 2017). Also, education is negatively associated with the risks of non-communicable diseases other than neoplastic diseases (Smith et al., 2015). Education, smoking, BMI, alcohol intake, and physical activity are correlated with biomarkers of epigenetic aging (Fiorito et al., 2019). Certain work conditions, such as night-shift work (Lin et al., 2015), strenuous occupational physical activity (Coenen et al., 2018) or prolonged occupational sitting (Kikuchi et al., 2015) might impede health and accelerate aging. Environmental toxic pollution is associated with increased mortality from aging-related diseases (Chowdhury et al., 2018; Pope et al., 2019). Social engagement (Rico-Uribe et al., 2018), meaningful work, and volunteering (Anderson et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2016) are associated with improved survival. Characteristics of a neighborhood and built-in environment may aﬀect health in older ages (Malambo et al., 2016). A highly-walkable or mountain environment predisposes individuals to physical activity and longevity (Pes et al., 2013). Therefore, aging can be attenuated, and healthy longevity maintained via various modiﬁcations of the environment through the lifecourse. 4.

Immune senescence and some aspects of hormonal aging stand out to some extent as less connected to other components of aging, which makes them less susceptible to therapeutic interventions. Unlike some previous systematic studies of aging (de Grey and Rae, 2007; López-Otín et al., 2013), our review was almost completely conﬁned to human studies. Our results are rather similar to these authors, which reﬂects growing understanding and consensus on the mechanisms of aging within the scientiﬁc community. Interestingly, our study has identiﬁed aging-related increased ﬁbrotic propensity as an asyet unrecognized hallmark of aging, in addition to traditionally suspected ones. We would also like to stress the importance of further human studies of epigenetic aspects of aging, DNA damage, as well as calcium metabolism in aging. Some important aspects of aging were not well studied in detail in human studies and could be added to research reviews on human aging in the future. We hope that future research on aging will allow for the development of a more unifying framework that can reduce fragmentation of the various approaches, indicators and interventions. A number of interventions were identiﬁed, including lifestyle changes, approved drugs and supplements, which proved eﬀective for the prevention of more than one aging-related pathological process. We feel that our success in introducing aging into the ICD is an important step toward opening the doors to treating aging-related diseases. However, the need to include aging per se as a unitary disease or a separate classiﬁcation of aging-related pathologies in the future ICD frameworks is still present in order to facilitate the development of clinical practice guidelines and therapies to alleviate health burden associated with aging and aging-related diseases (Calimport, 2019). 

{Conclusions}
5. Conclusions 

This review shows that human aging can be described in terms of the WHO criteria for disease, including symptomatology, aetiology, course and outcomes of the disease, possible and potential interventions, and linkage to genetic and environmental factors. Pathogenetic processes of aging are highly interconnected (Fig. 1), and therefore, aging can be deﬁned as complex of several mutually-inﬂuencing pathological processes. The set of major pathogenetic processes of aging identiﬁed in this study can be used for the development of clinically signiﬁcant panels of aging biomarkers targeting individual pathological processes. Finally, we conclude that aging ﬁts all of the six disease criteria developed for the ICD-11 and can be considered a disease. The argument whether aging is a disease or a syndrome may look like a merely semantic matter, however, considering aging a disease may accelerate the development and implementation of innovative technologies to prevent and cure aging-related pathologies.
